# Project Euler in C

*Note*: This project is always in heavy development and is for learning
purposes. Please don't expect anything to work. Feel free to criticize and
share your opinions.

So I've been wanting to pickup more C. Especially since it's so widely used in
a lot of the projects I'm using on my Linux workstation setup. I figured a good
way to do this was to actually finish Project Euler and see what I can do!
I might include some other random C projects here as well as I'm learning along
with any notes I need for myself.

Also, this `Makefile` is super handy, so I want to keep that around as well.
