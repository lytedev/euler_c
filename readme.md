# Project Euler in C

So I've been wanting to pickup more C. Especially since it's so widely used in
a lot of the projects I'm using on my Linux workstation setup. I figured a good
way to do this was to actually finish Project Euler and see what I can do!
I might include some other random C projects here as well as I'm learning along
with any notes I need for myself.

Also, this `Makefile` is super handy, so I want to keep that around as well.
